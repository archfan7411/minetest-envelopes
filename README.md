# How to use
Blank envelopes are crafted with 6 paper. Punch with a blank envelope to open the letter-wrting formspec, which
allows you to specify an addressee, letter text, and an optional "Attn." field which will be displayed in the
envelope description. Once writing is complete, the envelope is sealed by pressing the "Seal" button. The blank
envelope is then replaced by a sealed envelope which shows the sender, addressee, and optionally the Attn. field in
the description. If the addressee punches with the sealed envelope, it will become an opened envelope, which, once
punched, shows a formspec with the text. While a sealed envelope is only openable by the addressee, an opened
envelope can be read by anyone - thus, secret correspondence should be pulverized.
